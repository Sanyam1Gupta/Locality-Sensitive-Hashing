# Clustering using Locality Sensitive Hashing

This project focuses on a clustering task to determine similar documents using Locality Sensitive Hashing technique(LSH).LSH hashes input items so that similar items map to the same “bins” with high probability (the number of "bins" being much smaller than the universe of possible input items).
(This mini-project is a part of Machine Learning specialization course, dataset or any pre-trained weights/models used were provided by Coursera.)
